I have analyzed DVD rental data using postgresql in PG Admin along with the tools of sql.

It seems to be describing a relational database schema for a DVD rental system. Here's an overview of how these tables can be structured and related to one another,
along with a brief explanation of their purpose:

**KEY TABLES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP**

1. Actor Table
Purpose: Stores details about actors.
Fields:
actor_id (Primary Key)
first_name
last_name

2. Films Table
Purpose: Stores details about films available for rent.
Fields:
film_id (Primary Key)
title
description
release_year
language_id (Foreign Key to language table)
rental_duration
rental_rate
length
rating_id (Foreign Key to rating table)

3. Staff Table

Purpose: Stores details about the staff managing rentals.
Fields:
staff_id (Primary Key)

4. Rentals Table

9. Customer Table

10. Address Table

**SCHEMA EXAMPLE**

Here’s how the relationships look:

Actor ↔ Film (Many-to-Many via film_actor)
Film ↔ Inventory ↔ Stor
Customer ↔ Rental ↔ Staff
Film ↔ Language


To include features like ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN, and SQL clauses like ASC, DESC, OFFSET, and LIMIT in a DVD Rental ER Diagram, 
we focus on how data is structured in the database schema to support these queries.

Here’s a textual description of a conceptual ER Diagram for a DVD Rental system with query-supporting attributes:

**ENTITIES AND ATTRIBUTE**

1. Customer

CustomerID (Primary Key)
Name
Email
Phone

2. Rental

RentalID (Primary Key)
RentalDate
ReturnDate
CustomerID (Foreign Key from Customer)
DVDID (Foreign Key from DVD)

3. DVD

DVDID (Primary Key)
Title
Genre
ReleaseYear
Price

4. Staff

StaffID (Primary Key)
Name
Role

5. Payment

PaymentID (Primary Key)
RentalID (Foreign Key from Rental)
PaymentDate
Amount

**RELATIONSHIPS**

1. Customer rents DVDs through the Rental table.

2. Each Rental is linked to a Payment.

3. Staff manages the rental and return process.


**FEATURES OF SQL QUERIES**

1. ORDER BY

Support sortable fields like RentalDate in the Rental entity, Price in DVD.


2. GROUP BY

Aggregate queries based on Genre in DVD or CustomerID in Rental.


3. JOIN

Relationships ensure JOIN operations across Customer, Rental, DVD, and Payment.


4. ASC/DESC

Sort orders can be applied on any date or numeric fields.


5. OFFSET/LIMIT

Pagination on query results like rentals or payments.
